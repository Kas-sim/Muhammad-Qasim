# MUHAMMAD QASIM

Practical engineer — focused on clean design, reliable automation, and workflow velocity.

---

## Core competencies
- **Java (OOP & DSA)** — object-oriented design and algorithmic problem solving.  
- **Bash / Shell** — robust automation, maintenance scripts, and repeatable system tasks.  
- **C++ / Qt** — performant native code and desktop tooling; systems and cross-platform GUI competence.  
- **Python** — fast prototyping, tooling, and data-processing utilities.  
- **Java Swing** — legacy desktop UI and maintenance/migration of older codebases.  
- **Neovim & dotfiles** — editor-driven workflows, custom mappings, and reproducible developer environments.  
- **Arch Linux & system configs** — hands-on Linux ecosystem management, package/config lifecycle, and environment hardening.  
- **Keyboard & short-cut mastery** — efficiency-first workflows; cross-OS remaps and ergonomics.

## Market-facing positioning (how this adds value)
- Reduce operational toil: automated scripts that lower manual intervention and incident time.  
- Ship maintainable systems: OOP + DSA knowledge for scalable, testable code.  
- Improve developer velocity: editor and config work that shortens onboarding and debugging.  
- Bridge legacy & modern: ability to support old desktop stacks while building modern tooling.

---

## Quick usage (how to present this)
- Resume headline: `Java (OOP & DSA) • Systems Automation • Neovim & Linux Power-User`  
- Interview checklist: be ready with OOP design examples, a couple of shell scripts, and a short demo of your dotfiles or editor workflow.  
- Hiring signal: emphasize measurable outcomes (time saved, ops reduced, reliability gains).
