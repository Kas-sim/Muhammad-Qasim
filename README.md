> Learning by building, refining by breaking.  

Currently shaping my skills around a few essentials:

**Code**  
→ Java, with focus on Data Structures & Algorithms  

**Shell**  
→ Bash scripting for automation and clarity  

**System**  
→ Arch Linux btw, tuned through configs and custom keybindings  

**Workflow**  
→ Mastering the terminal, shortcuts across OS’s, and Neovim as home base btw

This space is my logbook — configs, small projects, and experiments that map the journey forward.
